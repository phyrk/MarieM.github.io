    <h2 class="project-title">Automating Credit Card & Online Payment Data Transformation </h2>

  <h3>Description:</h3> 
      <p>Each day, credit card and online payment files are uploaded into HRC (internal reconciliation system). These files need to be transformed and validated to match daily bank deposits before being loaded. 

      Previously, this process involved manual file cleanup, multiple copy-paste steps, and a lot of attention to avoid mismatches between payment reports and bank data.  
      Thanks to automation, the file processing time was reduced from 1 hour to just 5 minutes, significantly increasing efficiency and allowing staff to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>

    <h3> Solution</h3>
    <p>I developed an automated workflow using Power Query and VBA macros to streamline this daily process. </p>


    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Dynamic Parameters in Power Query</strong> :The tool uses dynamic file paths and parameters to automatically switch between new data sources each day ‚Äî no need to manually update queries.  </li>
      <li> <strong>Data Transformation & Cleanup </strong> Raw payment files are cleaned and formatted through Power Query to meet HRC‚Äôs required structure.   </li>
      <li> <strong>Validation Control </strong> An additional control step was added to verify that transformed totals match daily bank deposit records, helping catch discrepancies early.   </li>
      <li> <strong>VBA Macros for Triggering </strong> A lightweight macro helps trigger the query refresh and final export to make the process one-click for end users.</li>
    
    </ul>
<h3>Result </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Time Saved: Reduced daily processing time significantly (exact hours depend on volume)   </li>
      <li> Accuracy Improved: Automated control step ensures payment data aligns with bank deposits before upload    </li>
      <li> Ease of Use: Designed for non-technical users ‚Äî all they need to do is drop in the new file and click a button    </li>
      <li> Scalability: Works with any number of daily files thanks to dynamic parameters </li>
    
    </ul>
 

    <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Power Query (with parameterized data sources) </li>
      <li>Excel VBA (for automation) </li>
      <li>HRC (internal reconciliation system) </li>
      <li>Daily bank reports for validation  </li>

    </ul>
